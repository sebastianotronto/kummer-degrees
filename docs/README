The file preprint.pdf is the preprint of the paper where the theory on whic
this script is based is developed.

In the filde af_code.pdf we break down the code for computing the adelic
failure. The aim is to bridge the gap between the theory and the SageMath code,
making it possible for the reader to check that the code actually computes the
correct degrees.
